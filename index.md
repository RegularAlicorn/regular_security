* Another heavy Ivanti Issue, this time in [Virtual Traffic Manager](https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Virtual-Traffic-Manager-vTM-CVE-2024-7593?language=en_US)  
Apparently you can modify with at least sudo privileges on Unix-OS level from outside.
* [Hacker leaked american SSNs of virtually every US citizen](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-27-billion-data-records-with-social-security-numbers/) (330 mil. population vs. 2.7 billion records leaked. Dublicated entries explain this)
    * the SSN is tied to a person from birth and can not be changed. It's used to loans, credits and more
    * if you are affected, make sure to watch your finances and consider e.g. freezing credit
    * [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-3-billion-people-national-public-data-breach/) suggests, this breach contains mostly bad webscraping data, already dead peoples data nad other unfitting contents. This paints the whole breach more of a "not-so-important"-color. Still, take care and monitor your credits. Treat this "unverified" for now.
* [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/15/revealed-disinformation-team-jorge-claim-meddling-elections-tal-hanan) reported about an isreali group allegedly meddling with 33 pressidental elections around the world
